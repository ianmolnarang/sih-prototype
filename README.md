## Nirmal Bharat Application


 • **निर्मल** • (nirmal) (indeclinable)
 **pure**, **clean** 

The solid wastes have become a major consequence of development, modernization, and urbanization. The solid wastes affect the natural environment and pose a serious threat as these materials remain in one place or a relatively longer period unless removed, burned, or washed away. In this respect solid waste has been identified as significant matter for sustainable development. Growth in population and change in lifestyle has led to an increase In solid waste generation. Both the residential and commercial waste are in solid or semi solid form Safe and cost-effective solid waste management is a great challenge for the modern society.

**It is estimated that 40% of the waste remains uncollected.**

This project aims for a technical solution for the management of solid wastes by providing **visibility on city sanitation, route planning for garbage collection, resource optimization, visibility of bins to maximize waste collection.**
## What we doing?


We aim to build **connection, communication, and collaboration(3C’s)** between the **Users** and the **Municipal Corporation** in a technical way by making an app. 
## Features

• **Schedule Garbage Pick-up**: Users can book or schedule the picking of garbage with the app by submitting a photo and quantity of waste.

• **Earn Credits**: Users earn credits by using the app and can convert them into coupons for discounts on bills.

• **Live Garbage Truck Tracking**: Track garbage truck location for accurate arrival times and reduce noise pollution with an alarm system.

• **Dynamic Route Planning**: The app provides the shortest and most efficient route for garbage trucks.

• **Resource Management with Machine Learning**: The app identifies areas with increasing solid waste and manages labor and truck resources.

• **Payment Gateway**: Users can pay for services via the app.

• **Complaint for Credits**: Users can report contaminated areas and receive credits for successful complaints.

• **Refer and Earn**: Users can earn credits by inviting others to use the app.


# Note: This is just a prototype, not a final product.
# Problem Statement
Suggest a solution to help municipal bodies maximise solid waste collection with their given resources.

# Structure
This is a WebApp which contains 3 tabs
1. Admin (Municipal corporation)
2. Employee (Curbside Truck driver)
3. User (People like us)

# Solution (Prototype)
We will give users reward to dispose the solid waste and then convert those rewards into deduction of water bill. 

# Problems (Stated by Evaluators)
1. What is the total cost which Municipal corporation has to suffer during the implimentation of this project?
2. How will you make sure that older people, who are responsible for dispossal of waste, are comfortable with this tech and UI?
3. What if someone clicks wrong pictures of waste and uploads it just to get some credits?
4. WHat if a curbside truck driver is not following the rules and involves himself in some corruption?
5. Why would people install your App?

# Solutions (During hackathon)
1. Municipal corporation has to train some curbside truck drivers to give credits based on user's waste and they have to bear the cost of hosting the server.
2. For the comfort os users, we made the simplest possible UI. You just have to press a button and then boom. We also made a android app so that everyone can access it around the globe.
3. We have implemented a ML model known as BOTO which tells you if there is waste in that clicked picture or not, in our android app.
4. For corruption related problems, we have estabilish a one-to-one communication between Employee and the User. Afterwards, A small trainig part is also added.
5. Firstly, people are getting credits and talking about reach, we made an API which grab data from user and give that to our website. We have created a opetion to book a curbside truck for pickup under orders menu in zomato. If user checks it then his/her name, location will be sent to the website and automatically books the pickup appointment.
6. We have also build an alarm system in which when a curbside truck enter in 100m radius then it starts ringing in your phone that curbside truck is near.

# Conclusion
Although we didn't win in Grand Finale Of Smart India Hackathon but we learnt many things along the process and we wish to carry forward this project without any hesitaion because we feel this idea holds something and have the capability to bring a change in the world.

Some learnings are:
1. Idea with best approach over anything. 
2. Be Practical over Theoritical.
3. Focus on Quantity And Quality.
4. Be Straight Forward with your work.
5. Over Confidence will snatch your opportunity.
